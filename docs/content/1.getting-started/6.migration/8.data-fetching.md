# Fetching Data

Nuxt 3 provides a lot of new options for [fetching data from an API](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/usage/data-fetching). Most of the new options involve composable methods provided by Nuxt 3.

## Isomorphic fetch

In Nuxt 2 you might use `@nuxtjs/axios` or `@nuxt/http` to fetch your data - or just the polyfilled global `fetch`. In Nuxt 3 you can use a globally available `$fetch` method that has the same API as [the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).

It has a number of benefits, including:

1. It will handle 'smartly' making [direct API calls](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/concepts/server-engine#direct-api-calls) if it's running on the server, or making a client-side call to your API if it's running on the client. (It can also handle calling third-party APIs.)

2. Plus, it comes with convenience features including automatically parsing responses and stringifying data.

You can read more [in the docs](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/concepts/server-engine#direct-api-calls).

## Using composables

Nuxt 3 provides new composables for fetching data: `useAsyncData` and `useFetch`. They each have 'lazy' variants (`useLazyAsyncData` and `useLazyFetch`), which do not block client-side navigation.

In Nuxt 2, you'd fetch your data in your component using a syntax similar to:

```ts
export default {
  async asyncData({ params, $http }) {
    const post = await $http.$get(`https://api.nuxtjs.dev/posts/${params.id}`)
    return { post }
  },
  // or alternatively
  fetch () {
    this.post = await $http.$get(`https://api.nuxtjs.dev/posts/${params.id}`)
  }
} 
```

Within your methods and templates, you could use the `post` variable similar how you'd use any other piece of data provided by your component.

With Nuxt 3, you can perform this data fetching using composables in your `setup()` method or `<script setup>` tag:

```vue
<script setup>
  // Define params wherever, through `defineProps()`, `useRoute()`, etc.
  const { data: post, refresh } = await useAsyncData('post', () => $fetch(`https://api.nuxtjs.dev/posts/${params.id}`) )
  // Or instead - useFetch is a convenience wrapper around useAsyncData when you're just performing a simple fetch
  const { data: post, refresh } = await useFetch(`https://api.nuxtjs.dev/posts/${params√å.id}`)
</script>
```

You can now use `post` inside of your Nuxt 3 template, or call `refresh` to update the data.

::alert{type=info}
Despite the names, `useFetch` is not a direct replacement of the `fetch()` hook. Rather, `useAsyncData` replaces both hooks and is most customizable; it can do more than simply fetching data from an endpoint. `useFetch` is a convenience wrapper around `useAsyncData` for simply fetching data fromn an endpoint.
