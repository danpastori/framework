# Minor Upgrades
There are few minor upgrades that don't require an entire page dedicated to the process, but are still very important.

## Upgraded NuxtLink component
Most of the syntax and functionality are the same for the global [NuxtLink](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/usage/nuxt-link#nuxtlink) component. However, the component name has changed to have capital letters instead of hyphenated. Youu will have to update this component throughout your app.

::code-block
```vue [Nuxt 2]
<nuxt-link to="/">
  Home
</nuxt-link>
```

```vue [Nuxt 3]
<NuxtLink to="/">
  Home
</NuxtLink>
```
::code-block

## Referencing Environment Variables
To reference environment variables, you just have to update them within your component. Nuxt 3 still includes [dotenv support](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/usage/runtime-config#environment-variables) and run time configurations. However, when referencing these variables within your components, you will have to use the `useRuntimeConfig()` composable in your setup method.

If you have an environment variable that holds the base URL to your site:

```
BASE_URL=https://nuxtjs.org
```

you would update the reference to be:

::code-block
```vue [Nuxt 2]
this.$config.BASE_URL
```

```vue [Nuxt 3]
<script setup>
    const config = useRuntimeConfig();
    // config.BASE_URL
</script>
```
::code-block
