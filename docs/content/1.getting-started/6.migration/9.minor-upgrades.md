# Minor Upgrades

There are a few minor upgrades that don't require an entire page dedicated to the process, but are still very important.

## Upgraded NuxtLink component

Most of the syntax and functionality are the same for the global [NuxtLink](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/usage/nuxt-link#nuxtlink) component. If you have been using the shortcut `<NLink>` format, you should update this to use `<NuxtLink>`.

`<NuxtLink>` is now a drop-in replacement for _all_ links, even external ones. You can read more about it, and how to extend it to provide your own link component, [in the docs](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/usage/nuxt-link#nuxtlink).

## Referencing Environment Variables

To reference environment variables, you just have to update them within your component. Nuxt 3 still includes [dotenv support](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/usage/runtime-config#environment-variables) and run time configurations. However, when referencing these variables within your components, you will have to use the `useRuntimeConfig()` composable in your setup method.

If you have an environment variable that holds the base URL to your site:

```sh
BASE_URL=https://nuxtjs.org
```

you would update the reference to be:

::code-block

```vue [Nuxt 2]
<script>
export default {
  mounted () {
    this.$config.BASE_URL
  }
}
</script>
```

```vue [Nuxt 3]
<script setup>
  const config = useRuntimeConfig();
  // config.BASE_URL
</script>
```

::code-block
